                    <h3>&emsp;At Beloit College, I have had the opportunity to take many courses to improve and develop new skills. Through my computer science courses and side projects I am always improving my development skills in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP. In my Algroithm Design and Analysis class, I learned about the different kinds of algorithms that you can use to store memory, retrieve memory, and improve run time. My business economics courses are also always helping me to improve my presentation and communication skills. My class, Introduction to Entrepreneurship, required lots of communicating and presenting on how our business was doing.</h3>
